-- Description : Formatter types and operations.
--
-- 'Formatter' is a (potential) formatter for a file. It contains a method,
-- 'runFormat', which takes a relative path to a file and, by inspecting the
-- path alone, must decide whether to format the file or not. To specify if the
-- file will be formatted by that formatter, it returns a 'FormattingDirective'.
--
-- If the 'FormattingDirective' is 'Format' then that constructor supplies a
-- function which can take the 'FileContent', and return a 'FormattingResult'.
-- In turn, the 'FormattingResult' specifies the result of formatting.
--
-- To implement a new 'Formatter', return a new 'Formatter' instance, which
-- inspects the file path and, if the file can be formatted by that 'Formatter',
-- return a 'Format' constructor containing the formatting operation.
--
-- All aspects of the 'Formatter' operation are pure or "effectively pure". If
-- 'IO' operations are required, they should be implemented in 'unsafePerformIO'
-- as effectively-pure operations.
